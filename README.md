# orbits

This is a project to mess around with orbit computations. 

It was inspired by a recent discussion on the Minor Planet Mailing List (MPML) where it was asked "How did Guass predict the orbit of Ceres?". A lot of interesting posts were made about that topic, and it was pointed out that it really isn't that complicated.

Thus, I created this to try out some of those ideas.
